How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Confidence that the software produced is safe and functional comes first from an adherence to the idustry's code of ethics. Functional and secure software is best pursued through early test design and implementation. White-box techniques can ensure structural integrity and clean code, while black-box techniques can ensure the program mirrors the project requirements.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
 User needs are collected at the start of a project through various methods of interviewing and solicitation. Information gathered this way is translated to clearly defined and formally documented software requirement specifications. These requirements are the key component to incorporating user needs into a program. Requirements should be referenced often throughout code development and testing.

 How do I approach designing software?
  To ensure the end product meets the client's expectations, software design should be approached via requirement specifications. Early test design and implementation should also be prioritized at the outset of a project -- reducing the risk for failure in functionality, security, and unexpected time and budget expenses.
